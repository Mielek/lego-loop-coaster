# Ride automatization for lego loop coaster

I received lego loop coaster on christmas. From that time I had a great idea to build a ride automatization like riding on-demand or riding on every hour. I wanted to be able to know where lift is, where cart is and possibly handle some of the issues which can happen when coaster would run constantly.
